Description: The goal of this package is to allow users to robustly and quickly
    grid and quantify sizes of pinned colonies in plate images. gitter works by
    first finding the grid of colonies from a preprocessed image and then locating
    the bounds of each colony separately. It includes several image pre-processing
    techniques, such as autorotation of plates, noise removal, contrast adjustment
    and image resizing.
